# RLShortestPath
Demo source for finding shortest path in undirected graph using Q-learning technique - one of the reinforcement learning algorithms.
The code is C++ traslation from python, insired by exelent Pluralsight course, namely [Understanding Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/understanding-algorithms-reinforcement-learning/description). Please subscribe to fully understand and play with the demo code.
